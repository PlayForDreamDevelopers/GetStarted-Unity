# Advanced Features

This section works as an introduction for the advanced features for developers' specific requirements or optimizations.

So far, advanced features includes:
1. [HMD/Controller Emulator](../../com.yvr.core/Documentation~/AdvancedFeatures/HMDControllerEmulator.md): Tools that allow you to use keyboard and mouse to simulate the behaviour of HMD/controllers in Unity Editor mode.
2. [Fixed Foveated Rendering](../../com.yvr.core/Documentation~/AdvancedFeatures/FixedFoveatedRendering.md): A feature that reduces resolution of the edge of rendering texture in order to save GPU load.
3. [MultiView Stereo Rendering](../../com.yvr.core/Documentation~/AdvancedFeatures/MultiviewStereoRendering.md): A feature that supports rendering content to both eye layers simultaneously.
