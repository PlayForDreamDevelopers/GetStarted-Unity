# Unity Audio Source

Audio Clip is required to create an Audio Source. The Clip is the actual sound file that will be played back. The Source is like a controller for starting and stopping playback of that clip, and modifying other audio properties.

To create a new Audio Source:

1. Import your audio files into your Unity Project. These are now Audio Clips.

2. Go to `GameObject -> Create Empty` from the menubar.

3. With the new GameObject selected, select `Component -> Audio -> Audio Source`.

4. In the Inspector, find the Audio Clip property on the Audio Source Component and assign a clip, either by dragging one from the Project Window or by clicking the small circle icon to the right of the Inspector property, then selecting a clip from the list.

> [!Note]
> If you want to create an **Audio Source** just for one **Audio Clip** that you have in the Assets folder then you can just drag that clip to the scene view - a GameObject with an Audio Source component will be created automatically for it. 
> 
> Dragging a clip onto on existing GameObject will attach the clip along with a new Audio Source if there isnâ€™t one already there. If the object does already have an Audio Source then the newly dragged clip will replace the one that the source currently uses.
