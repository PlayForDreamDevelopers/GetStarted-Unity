# Demo Scenes

This section works as an introduction for all demo scenes included in the SDK.

In order to better illustrate each module in SDK, several demo scenes are included in SDK:

1. [BoxWorld](./DemoScenes/BoxWorld.md): The most basic scene which illustrates 6-dof tracking state of both controllers and head.
2. [Input](./DemoScenes/Input.md): The scene is used to illustrate and debug YVRInput APIs.
3. [Raycasting](./DemoScenes/Raycasting.md): The scene is used to illustrate how to interact with UGUI and Physical Collider.
4. [Composite Layer](./DemoScenes/CompositeLayer.md): The scene is used to illustrate composite layer effect.
